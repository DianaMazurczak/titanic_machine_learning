# Titanic - binary classification problem

## Purpose of the work
In my work I would like to compare a few simple classification models, which are designed to predict which passengers have survived. 

## Methods used for classification:
* Logistic regression
* KNN - K-Nearest Neighbors
* SVM - Support Vector Machines
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
